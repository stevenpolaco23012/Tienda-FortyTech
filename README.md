<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Velzck Shop] `JavaScript` `HTML` `CSS` <a name="about-project"></a>
![mockup](https://github.com/VelzckC0D3/Velzck_Shop/assets/92229666/e2df9ad7-0dcc-470d-9b7e-12637969b2c6)

VelzckShop is an e-commerce demo website designed to exhibit my proficiency in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
It features a grid-based layout displaying a range of products. This project does not include any backend functionality or external API/database connections.
Its primary purpose was to showcase my ability to develop an aesthetically pleasing, modern, and user-friendly e-commerce design using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
